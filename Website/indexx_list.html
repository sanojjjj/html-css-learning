    <h4>Mythical Creatures</h4>
    <dl style="background-color:goldenrod; border:3px solid;">

        <dt>Dragon</dt>
        <dd>A dragon is a legendary,, powerful, and often massive reptilian creature found in worldwide folklore, typically characterized as a fire-breathing, winged, scaly beast with sharp claws and a long, serpentine body. While European dragons are generally depicted as malevolent, winged, four-legged monsters guarding treasure, East Asian dragons are often seen as wise, wingless, serpentine symbols of good fortune and nature. </dd>
        <dt>Pheonix</dt>
        <dd>The phoenix is a legendary, immortal bird symbolizing renewal, rebirth, and the sun. Typically described as eagle-sized with brilliant red and gold plumage, it lives for 500+ years before building a spice nest, combusting in flames, and rising from the ashes to start a new life. </dd>
        <dt>Vampire</dt>
        <dd>A vampire is a supernatural, undead being from folklore and fiction that survives by feeding on the vital essence—typically blood—of the living. Often depicted as pale, fanged, and nocturnal, these beings possess superhuman strength, can transform into bats or mist, and are commonly repelled by garlic or crucifixes. </dd>
        <dt>werewolf</dt>
        <dd>A werewolf (or lycanthrope) is a mythological human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or a hybrid wolf-human creature, typically triggered involuntarily by a full moon. Common descriptions include fur-covered bodies, razor-sharp fangs and claws, glowing eyes, and heightened, uncontrollable aggression. They are often portrayed as having immense strength, speed, and durability, often only vulnerable to silver weapons. </dd>
